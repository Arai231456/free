          <h2>Early Life</h2>
Ariana Grande-Butera was born on June 26, 1993, in Boca Raton, Florida.[14][15] She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment,[16] and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton.[17][18] Grande is of Italian descent,[19] and has described herself as an Italian American with Sicilian and Abruzzese roots.[20] She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an entertainer and producer,[21][22] and she has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.[23] Her family moved from New York to Florida before her birth, and her parents separated when she was eight or nine years old.[18]

<h2>Voice</h2>
Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant."[281] Grande responded to the comparisons, "[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine."[271] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, "With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]â€”and that's okay."[280]

Mark Savage of BBC News commented, "Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control".[19] In The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice "can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced."[282]
<h2>Public image</h2>
Grande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style "a little boring" as her career has progressed.[284][285] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[285] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as "age appropriate" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[281] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention "for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings."[286]


<h2>Personal life</h2>
She is married now with Dalton Gomez and pregnant with her first child.
